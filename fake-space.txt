SPACE 

Space refers to the area that a shape or form occupies.
It also refers to the background against which we see
the shape or form. Space can be defined as positive
and negative. The positive space of a design is the
filled space in the designâ€”often it is the shapes
that make up the design. Negative space is the
background. The negative space in design is as
important as the positive area.
